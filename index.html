<summary>What is this?</summary>
<p>Montreal has a badass rent-a-bike service called Bixi. Unfortunately, the Bixi official website is extremely slow, and, to my taste, so are apps like Transit. This mini-app is meant to instantaneously inform you about nearby Bixi stations. It may not work on very old phones. Make sure browser geolocation services are enabled!</p>
